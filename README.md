# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
Pizza sales analysis project using Python and MySQL to uncover revenue patterns, customer demand, top-selling pizzas, and business trends with data cleaning, visualizations, and KPI-based performance insights.
Pizza Sales Data Analysis using Python & MySQL

**Purpose of craeting this Project**

Starting this Pizza Sales Analysis project, I wanted to understand how real businesses use data to make smart decisions. Initially, I had only raw pizza sales data files, with no clear structure or insights. I struggled with figuring out where to begin ‚Äî how to clean the data, which questions to ask, and how to convert everything into meaningful results.

To solve this, I first imported and cleaned the data using Python and Pandas. The next challenge was extracting deep insights from the database. So, I designed SQL queries in MySQL to answer real business questions like best-selling pizzas, highest revenue days, and customer order patterns. Slowly, the data started revealing powerful trends.

Visualizing those insights was another step. Using Python‚Äôs visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, I created charts that showed which pizza categories performed best and what times brought maximum sales. Each result helped me build a strong understanding of business performance and customer preferences.

Through this project, I learned how to handle end-to-end data analytics: cleaning, querying, visualizing, and transforming numbers into insights that support decision-making. What started as messy data finally became a complete analytical story that reflects real industry challenges ‚Äî and how data drives smarter business strategies.
